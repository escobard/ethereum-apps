# Udemy - Ethereum Applications

The purpose of this repository is to create some boilerplate applications that can be expanded in the future for client and personal projects.

In addition, this repository contains all of my own programming files, notes, applications, and libraries for the [Ethereum and Solidity: The complete developer's guide](https://www.udemy.com/ethereum-and-solidity-the-complete-developers-guide) course with [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com). 

## Installation & Usage

To install and run this locally on your computer, you will need a local web to open the files in this repository with a text editor, or preview them on a browser.

You may also clone this locally to your computer, using the following line of code:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/escobard/ethereum-apps.git
```

To run the tests, ensure that your application is connected a MongoDB instance (expand on that later, instructions on local usage below):
```
$ installation instructions found within each application's folder
```

## Notes on blockchain, ethereum, smart contracts, solidity & other theory:
