## Smart contract deployment boilerplate

The purpose of this application is to provide a boilerplate for smart contract with solidity including:
	- contract creation - set up solidity compiler to build our contracts.
		- this allows us to generate the BYTE code necessary to deploy, and the code necessary to interact on the front end with JS
	- local testing - set up mocha tester runner to test solidity code.
	- deployment - set up deploy script to compile + deploy our contract.
